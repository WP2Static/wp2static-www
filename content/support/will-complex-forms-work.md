Hi there,

Gravity Forms, probably not for multi-page forms, as they're storing data in between screens.

Many other form and search options available, I've just listed a few here:

 - https://wp2static.com/docs/basics/contact-forms-for-static-sites/
 - https://wp2static.com/docs/basics/search-options-for-static-sites/

Please let me know how you go.

Cheers,

Leon
