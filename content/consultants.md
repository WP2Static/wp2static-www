Looking for help outside of what the community and I can provide in the public forums? Want to go static but have more $ than time and want to offload it?

Here are some users of WP2Static who I know to be knowledgable and passionate about static hosting and site speed optimisations.

I can't guarantee their availability or interest in your particular job, but worth contacting them and seeing if they can help.

### Other experts

You can browse commits to [WP2Static's GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/szepeviktor) to find those active and knowledgable in WP2Static. I'll add people here from time to time, if you'd like to get listed here and I know you from real life or the forums, GitHub, etc, please ask me.

### WordPress/PHP expertise

I cannot speak highly enough of [Viktor Szepe](https://github.com/szepeviktor). He does amazing code quality work for some major WP plugins and was the one to give me a needed kick in the pants to start improving WP2Static's code quality! Magyar/English
