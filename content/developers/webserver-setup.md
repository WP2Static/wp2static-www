WP2Static should work on any web server setup, see [System Requirements](/docs/getting-started/system-requirements/) for the least you should consider.

I'm developing deployment and utility scripts for an optimized WordPress server for WP2Static testing on a $5/month Vultr VPS with OpenBSD -current as the operating system. I'll soon start sharing here the code I use for anyone who wants to replicate or borrow parts from. It's not a very mainstream setup, but I find OpenBSD to be the best fit for me.

If you're needing help on specific local or remote WordPress setups, the best place to ask is on our [Forum](https://www.staticword.press/c/wordpress-static-site-generators/wp2static/), where another user or I can help.
