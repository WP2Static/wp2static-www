### Promote static websites. Profit!

Join the mission to help more users go from insecure, slow-loading WordPress sites to secure and performant static sites.

Becoming an affiliate gives you the chance to earn commissions while promoting WP2Static’s premium offerings on your blog, social media, YouTube channel or podcast.

### Guaranteed tracking for your sales

Cookies & tracking codes are decreasingly effective with astute users blocking such methods (for good reason!). We provide all affiliates with unique coupon codes, along with a % discount to offer their audience.

### We cover any transfer fees

Payouts are made to you monthly, after the 30-day refund period we provide the users. Commisions can be paid out via PayPal or bank transfer. You get the exact commission amount, the transfer fees are covered by us.

### No minimum payout amount

Whether you’ve referred 1 or 100 sales in the month, you’ll be paid out your balance.

### Transparent commissions tier

Refer a sale to the Lifetime Purchase (Single-site) and earn $20 commission. Offer your audience 20% off the regular price.

For the Lifetime Purchase (Unlimited-site), that increases to a $50 commission. Offer your audience 25% off the regular price.
