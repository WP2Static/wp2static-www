### Due dates?

I'm a solo developer, sometimes able to get in the zone and have great productivity. Other times, I can struggle for days/weeks to write a line of code.

In the past, I've rushed releases out to the official wp.org repository, which is especially painful, as some users may be auto-updating their plugins and for others, wp.org offers plugin/theme developers no way to contact their users to inform them of bugs or the need to rollback or upgrade to the next release.

For these reasons, I'm not going to commit to any deadlines other than "when it's ready":

 - when core functionality is solid
 - when it's been tested enough and I'm confident in the quality
 - when the documentation is up to date

### Pre-releases

Using pre-release versions or building your own installers from the [open source code](https://github.com/leonstafford/wp2static) is a way for you to get access to improvements before an official release. It also helps everyone if you on any issues you encounter or ideas for improvements.


### Roadmap / future features

Not included here is what's already available in published pre-release versions. This also doesn't include expected/incremental changes, like continual performance improvements

 - providing WP API/(+ GraphQL?) access to control WP2Static
 - multiple deploy configs (dropped from V7 initial release due to more complexity risk than reward)
 - more Deployment Add-ons (covering our whole [add-ons list](/addons/)
 - user access control (which WP user levels can use WP2Static)
 - addons for Forms, eCommerce, Comments
 - advanced add-ons to extend core (Detection, Crawling, Post-processing)
 - WPMU dashboard
 - optimized dev hosting images/provisioning scripts
 - free hosting for WP dev sites

### Something missing?

My vision as a solo developer vs 10,000+ user's experience is limited. Please [share](/contact) your use case stories and feature requests with me and they may get onto the roadmap!
